# CalAIM Assistant - Implementation Status Report

**Reporting Date:** June 6, 2025

This document outlines the current implementation status of the AI-Powered CalAIM Domain & Care Plan Assistant, detailing completed features, ongoing work, and remaining tasks based on the MVP plan.

## 1. Implemented and Tested Features

The following features and components have been substantially implemented and, where applicable, tested:

*   **Core Infrastructure & Dockerization:**
    *   **Docker Credential Fix:** A script (`scripts/fix-docker-credentials.sh`) to resolve common local Docker credential helper issues has been created and tested.
    *   **Base Infrastructure Services:** PostgreSQL, Redis, and MinIO (S3-compatible storage) are containerized using `scripts/infrastructure-compose.yaml`. These services have been successfully started and health-checked using `scripts/test-infrastructure.sh`.
    *   **Dockerfiles:** `Dockerfile.dev` for both `backend` and `ai-service` are in place. The backend Dockerfile was updated to correctly handle `pnpm` dependencies without a lockfile in the build context and to use a new entrypoint for migrations.
*   **Backend API (NestJS - `packages/backend`):**
    *   **Assessments Module:**
        *   `AssessmentsController`: Implemented with CRUD endpoints for assessments (GET all, GET by ID, POST create, PUT update) and assessment domains (GET all for assessment, GET specific domain, PUT update specific domain). Includes endpoints to complete and sign assessments.
        *   `AssessmentsService`: Contains the business logic for all controller actions, including Prisma ORM interactions for data persistence and validation logic.
        *   `AssessmentsModule`: Configured to integrate the controller and service.
        *   Relevant DTOs, API documentation (Swagger), and role-based access control decorators are included.
    *   **Database Migrations:**
        *   An `entrypoint.sh` script for the backend container now executes `prisma/migrations/run-migrations.sh`, which waits for the database to be ready and then applies Prisma migrations (`prisma migrate deploy`).
*   **AI Service (FastAPI - `packages/ai-service`):**
    *   **GCP Integration (Initial Implementation):**
        *   Functions for interacting with Google Cloud Document AI (`process_document_with_document_ai`) for OCR and Google Cloud Healthcare NL API (`extract_entities_with_healthcare_nl`) for entity extraction are present.
        *   A Pub/Sub listener (`start_pubsub_listener` and `process_document_job`) has been set up for asynchronous document processing.
    *   **Core Logic:** Functions for mapping extracted entities to CalAIM domains (`map_entities_to_domains`) and for basic confidence aggregation (`aggregate_entity_confidence`, `calculate_domain_confidence`) have been implemented.
    *   **Mocking:** The service can run in a mock mode (default) for local development without live GCP services. Health checks reflect the status of GCP client initialization.
*   **Development Tooling & Documentation:**
    *   **Setup Scripts:**
        *   `scripts/start-dev-environment.sh`: Created to provide a streamlined way to fix Docker credentials, stop old containers, and build/start the full development stack.
        *   `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`: A focused guide for initial project setup and running the core services.
    *   **Guides:**
        *   `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`: Significantly updated with comprehensive instructions for setup, development workflows, feature implementation, and troubleshooting.
        *   `README.md`: Updated to reflect the current project status, architecture, and point to detailed development guides.

## 2. Partially Implemented Features (Needing Further Work)

These features have seen initial development but require additional work, testing, or refinement:

*   **Backend API - Full Feature Parity for Other Modules:**
    *   While the `Assessments` module is well-developed, other core modules like `Referrals`, `Problems`, `CarePlans`, `Patients`, and `Users` have service and controller skeletons but need their specific business logic and CRUD operations fully implemented.
*   **Backend API - PDF Generation & Advanced File Upload:**
    *   These features, outlined in the MVP, have not yet been started. This includes PDF generation for care plans and robust file upload mechanisms (e.g., virus scanning, signed URLs).
*   **AI Service - GCP Integration Validation & Refinement:**
    *   **Real-World Testing:** The GCP integrations (Document AI, Healthcare NL API, Pub/Sub) need thorough testing with actual sample documents and a configured GCP environment (credentials, enabled APIs, correct processor IDs).
    *   **Confidence Scoring:** The confidence aggregation logic is in place but may need significant tuning based on results from real data.
    *   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for GCP API calls and Pub/Sub message processing needs to be solidified.
*   **Full Docker Compose Stack Validation (`scripts/dev-compose.yaml`):**
    *   While the backend Dockerfile was fixed, a full end-to-end test of `docker compose -f scripts/dev-compose.yaml up --build -d` successfully starting all services (postgres, redis, minio, backend, ai-service) and confirming their health and inter-service communication (e.g., backend to AI service, AI service to DB) is pending.
    *   Verification that Prisma migrations run correctly within the fully composed environment.
*   **Testing Coverage:**
    *   Unit and integration tests for the newly implemented backend (Assessments module) and AI service features need to be written and executed.

## 3. Features Remaining to be Implemented (MVP Plan)

The following key features from the original MVP plan are yet to be started or are in very early stages:

*   **Backend API:**
    *   Completion of domain endpoints for Referrals, Problem Lists, and Care Plans.
    *   Implementation of PDF generation.
    *   Advanced file upload features (virus-scan, signed-URL middleware).
*   **Frontend SPA (`packages/frontend`):**
    *   Currently a stub. Requires full development of Next.js pages for login, clinician dashboard, document upload, assessment review, problem list management, and care plan building, along with API integration.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Setup of Cloud Build for automated testing, Docker image building, and deployment to Cloud Run.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
    *   Full Terraform implementation for GCP resources (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, GCS, KMS, VPC-SC).
*   **Security Hardening:**
    *   Implementation of mTLS between services, CMEK rotation, and addressing potential pen-test findings.

## 4. Key Next Steps

1.  **Validate Full Docker Stack & Migrations:**
    *   Execute `./scripts/start-dev-environment.sh` to build and run the complete application stack (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, Backend, AI Service).
    *   Thoroughly verify that all services start, are healthy, and that backend database migrations apply correctly.
    *   Perform basic manual API tests on key endpoints of the running services.
2.  **Complete Backend API Development:**
    *   Prioritize implementing the full CRUD operations and business logic for `Referrals`, `Problems`, and `CarePlans` modules.
    *   Begin implementation of PDF generation and the enhanced file upload flow.
3.  **End-to-End AI Service Validation:**
    *   Configure the AI service with a test GCP project (credentials, API enablement, processor IDs).
    *   Process sample documents through the entire pipeline (upload -> Pub/Sub -> Document AI -> Healthcare NL API -> domain mapping).
    *   Analyze results to refine extraction logic, entity mapping, and confidence scoring.
4.  **Frontend Development Kick-off:**
    *   Begin development of core frontend Next.js pages and components.
    *   Start integrating the frontend with the existing backend authentication and assessment APIs.
5.  **Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   Write unit and integration tests for all implemented backend and AI service functionalities.
    *   Develop initial E2E tests for critical user workflows as backend and frontend features stabilize.
6.  **Initiate CI/CD Setup:**
    *   Start configuring a basic Cloud Build pipeline for automated linting, testing, and Docker image builds.

This focused approach will help solidify the current implementations and pave the way for completing the MVP.
